# Here's a basic header. You just need to precede it with a pound symbol

# Paragraphs

Paragraphs are written without anything special.
Pretty simple.

    Here is an indented parargraph
    
    And here's another one! Wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow
    Paragraphs work the same way as unindented lines and bullet point lines

# Lists

- This is a bullet point. It is a preceded by a hyphen then a space
It can have multiple lines. or if the line is really loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong, it will wrap.

- Also, you can nest bullet points by pressing tab:
    - Here is a nested list item!
    - and here is
    another item (on multiple lines)


- # Header's can be in a list! This is an easy way to bold an entire line.

    # Header's can also be indented

# Links

Below is a link. It is in the format [Link text](link url)
[Wow this is a link!](https://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/co/2017/08/mco2017080046-abs.html)

# Bold & Italic

What about bolding only part of some text? Or italics?
Just __bold like this__ or **like this**, and italic _like this_ or *like this*

# Images

Below is how you can load an image:

![here is some alt text](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png =100x200 "Example Title")

This image has the alt text "here is some alter text", the title "Example Title", and a size of 100 by 200 (width by height)

# Disclaimer

This is a customized version of markdown, headings and indented paragraphs work differently than normal markdown.
