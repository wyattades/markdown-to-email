Also getting attention from Slate are former EIS'ers Anne Sullivan (now an Assistant Professor at Univ. Central Florida) and Josh McCoy (now an Assistant Professor at UC Davis), whose game, <i>Loominary</i>, uses fabric color choices while weaving to move a Twine story along. It was also featured at the Smithsonian American Art Museum Arcade (SAAM Arcade).

Inside Scoop

We added 4 company members to our line up of research centers: Volley joined the Data Science (D3) Research Center; Huawei and Broadcom joined the Center for Research in Storage Systems (CRSS); and Western Digital joined the Center for Research in Open Source Software (CROSS).

The Baskin School of Engineering has a new graduate studies website! Kudos to the graduate advising team, Kristin Bradham and Abel Rodriguez for working together to launch the new site. This is BSOE's first Drupal 8 site. 
[Check out the site]{https://grad.soe.ucsc.edu/}

We'll be upgrading the rest of the BSOE sites over the next several months. We're working on a process and roadmap and will invite the BSOE community to participate and provide feedback. Stay tuned! 

The Hummingbird Computational Cluster has recently been upgraded to feature a new operating system, job scheduler, more nodes and faster storage. What makes Hummingbird so great? It has over 600 Intel and AMD cores linked together to crunch all types of university data.Because there are preinstalled software packages for science and engineering, faculty and students alike can use Hummingbird to compute large amounts of data without having to administer their own cluster. Hummingbird is available to anyone on campus with a Cruz ID!

Holger Schmidt’s lab has been honored with the 2016-2017 Lab Safety Recognition Award. His group accomplished several key tasks, including attending quarterly LSR meetings, completing inspection reports, and handling hazardous waste appropriately.

<b>Ten years ago, Dr. Camilla Forsberg received a grant for two million dollars</b> to study how the HSCs in mice decided their fate. The grant came from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM), the California stem cell program. Not only did Dr. Forsberg’s CIRM-sponsored research bring in seven million dollars to California, but it also paid off in people power. Since starting her lab at UCSC in 2007, over 50 trainees have worked and learned there: undergraduate and graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and other research scientists.
